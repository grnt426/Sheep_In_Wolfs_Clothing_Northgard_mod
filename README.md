Sheep in Wolf's Clothing
=======
This is a mod for Northgard.

Player's compete on a cut-throat island to determine...who is the fluffiest, most famous
sheep in all the land! Every two weeks players can choose between 3 resource rewards and 3 unit rewards. Each year these rewards increase in value. There are no buildings or resources on the map itself other than a few Pillars of Glory, which can be assigned two Heralds for fame.

The player who reaches 1500 fame or 100 sheep in their land is the winner!
